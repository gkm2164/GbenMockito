# GbenMockito

This project is for studying [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) library.
This project is inspired by an article (https://medium.com/@gorali/how-mockito-works-7d3a2c77da71), and try to complete the mockito library which would work almost as same as them.

Mockito is famous library which is mocking java class & can stub function calls to return desired value.

GbenMockito is to do actually same thing. Mocking class, stubbing function calls.

Without any detailed implementation, basically, with pattern matching, it can describe the methods.
